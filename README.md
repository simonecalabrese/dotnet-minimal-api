A boiler-plate web api with user authentication made with .NET 7.0 and MongoDB.

## Authentication
There's a custom JWT authentication using the [JWT.Net](https://github.com/jwt-dotnet/jwt) package.
It needs a certificate to be initialized so don't forget to switch the default example certificate with your personal certificate (and its key) inside the certificates folder if you're gonna use it for your personal projects
